## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the problems listed in the USACO Guide. The USACO Guide is an excellent resource for preparing for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) competitions, providing curated problem lists and educational content.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty levels as follows:

```
.
├── Bronze
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── Problem2
│       ├── problem2.py
│       └── README.md
├── Silver
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── Problem2
│       ├── problem2.py
│       └── README.md
├── Gold
│   ├── Problem1
│   │   ├── problem1.cpp
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── Problem2
│       ├── problem2.py
│       └── README.md
└── Platinum
    ├── Problem1
    │   ├── problem1.cpp
    │   └── README.md
    └── Problem2
        ├── problem2.py
        └── README.md
```

Each problem has its own folder containing the solution file and a README.md file with details about the problem and the approach used to solve it.
